### About me

Currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of the Philippines Diliman. I am currently part of the UP's Judo Team and have received two UAAP medals. I spend most of my free time reading, here are some of my favourite books/series. 
- Rememberance of Earth's Past by Cixin Liu
- Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons
- The Expanse by James S.A. Corey 
- The Gone World by Tom Sweterlitsch
