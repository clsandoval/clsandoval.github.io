Best bang for your buck snowboarding in Japan. Tokyo to powder in 90 minutes via shinkansen. So many resorts with free shuttles that you can hit a different mountain every day.

## Getting There
JR Joetsu Shinkansen from Tokyo to Echigo-Yuzawa (1h 20min). First train at 6:04 AM gets you to fresh tracks. Station connects directly to several resorts.

## Some of the resorts

**GALA Yuzawa** - Direct gondola from the train station. Busiest by far, honestly worth skipping.

**Kagura** - The powder spot. Highest elevation means best snow preservation. Amazing on a powder day - north-facing slopes that stay cold and fluffy. Connected to Naeba via long gondola ride.

**Naeba** - Big resort with everything. Connected to Kagura so you get massive terrain. Good mix of runs.

**Kandatsu Kogen** - Hidden gem. Night skiing until 2 AM and an incredible onsen with mountain views. After riding all day, soaking in hot springs while looking at the slopes you just rode is unbeatable.

**Yuzawa Kogen** - Panoramic views along one of the main courses that'll stop you mid-run. Less crowded than the big names.

## Why Yuzawa Works
The free shuttle system is perfect. Stay near the station and you can sample different mountains without a car. Each resort has a different character, some for powder, some for views, and some for night riding.

Learning to snowboard here was perfect. Gentle slopes, good snow, and when you get tired there's always an onsen nearby.

## Insider Tips

Hit Kagura right after storms - the powder stays good for days because of the elevation. Early morning at any resort means untracked runs.

The sake tasting bar in the station is dangerous after a day on the mountain. 100+ local varieties for ¥500.

## When to Go
January-February for powder. March for cheaper everything and still decent snow at elevation. Avoid Japanese holidays, weekends are great for firework shows and night skiing.

## Costs
- Shinkansen: ¥6,500 one way
- Lift tickets: ¥4,000-5,000/day
- Gear rental: ¥3,500/day
- Food: ¥2,500/day
- Accommodation: ¥6,000-12,000/night

## The Experience
Step off the bullet train directly into a gondola. It feels absurd how easy it is. Morning powder laps, afternoon onsen, evening sake tasting at the station. Tokyo to mountain to hot spring to home, all in one day.

The mountains aren't as dramatic as Nagano, but the convenience and variety make up for it. Perfect place to get your legs under you or just maximize mountain time with minimal travel hassle.
