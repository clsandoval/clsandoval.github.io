Yuzawa is Japan's most accessible powder destination from Tokyo. Step off the shinkansen directly into a gondola - Tokyo to first run in under 2 hours. Multiple resorts, reliable snow, and the convenience is unmatched.

## How to Get There
Tokyo to Echigo-Yuzawa Station via JR Joetsu Shinkansen (1 hour 20 minutes). Station connects directly to several resorts via shuttle or gondola. First train at 6:04 AM gets you to first lifts.

## When to Go
**Peak Powder**: January-February, especially mid-week after storms from the Sea of Japan. Northwest storms typically arrive Tuesday-Thursday, dropping 30-50cm overnight.

**Fewer Crowds**: Weekdays, avoid Japanese holidays. Weekend lift lines can be 15+ minutes.

**Budget Option**: Late season (March-April) for 30% cheaper accommodation, still good snow at higher elevations.

## Resorts

**GALA Yuzawa** - 17 courses, 340m vertical. Direct gondola from station makes it ideal for day trips. Beginner-friendly with dedicated learning area. Terrain park with rails and jumps. Best for convenience. Lift tickets ¥4,500/day.

**Naeba** - 196 trails across 1,500 hectares, 889m vertical. Largest resort with extensive sidecountry access and deep powder bowls. Host to Fuji Rock Festival in summer. 30 minutes from station by shuttle. Lift tickets ¥5,500/day.

**Kagura** - Highest altitude (1,845m), longest season (Nov-May). Best powder in the area due to elevation and exposure to storms. Connected to Naeba via Dragondola gondola for massive combined terrain. Lift tickets ¥4,800/day.

**Ishiuchi Maruyama** - 13 courses, 350m vertical. Good mix of terrain, night skiing until 8 PM. Less crowded than others. 15 minutes from station by bus. Lift tickets ¥4,200/day.

## Snow Conditions
Annual snowfall 10-12 meters. Best powder 24-48 hours post-storm when wind has settled. Monitor Japan Meteorological Agency forecasts - storms from Sea of Japan typically bring 30-50cm overnight. Base depth usually 2-3 meters by February.

## Where to Stay

**Ryokan near station** - ¥6,000-12,000/night, traditional experience with onsen. 10-minute walk to lifts.

## Equipment
Rental available at all resorts. ¥3,500/day for snowboard/boots/bindings. Quality is decent. Bring own gear if staying multiple days.

## The Experience
Morning powder turns at first light, stepping off the bullet train directly into a gondola feels surreal. Weekday mornings offer untracked runs until 10 AM when crowds arrive. The convenience is addictive - leave Tokyo at dawn, back by dinner.

## Insider Tips
- First gondola up (8:00 AM) for untracked powder
- Weekday lift tickets often 20-30% cheaper
- Many hotels offer lift ticket packages - book direct for best deals
- Station lockers (¥400/day) for gear storage between trips
- Download resort apps for real-time lift status and snow reports
- Onsen after riding is mandatory - most hotels have them, proper etiquette required
- Weather changes fast in mountains - carry layers and extra gloves

**Safety**: Check avalanche conditions for backcountry areas. Stay within resort boundaries unless properly equipped and experienced.
