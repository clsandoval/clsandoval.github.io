Small island off Negros. Good diving, quiet, decent for remote work. Go here when you want to disappear for a while.

## How to Get There
Manila to Dumaguete (1.5 hour flight), then ferry to Siquijor (1 hour). Book the ferry online - getting tickets in person is a pain.

## Where to Stay
**Lapyahan Guesthouse** - ₱800/night, beachfront, AC, budget but clean. Good value.

## Diving
**Apo Divers Resort** - around ₱1,500 per dive. Water's usually crystal clear. Turtles everywhere. Also tons of nudibranchs, lionfish, scorpion fish, lobster, crabs, shrimp.

**Best sites:**
- Paliton Wall - really nice
- Salagdoong Wall - reef sharks
- Tubod Marine Sanctuary - healthy coral
- Kagusuan Beach - easy shore dive

Water temp around 28°C. Morning dives have better visibility.

## Other Stuff
Freediving, beach hopping, waterfalls. Rent a motorbike to explore the island and mountains.

## Food
Food's okay but a little pricey. Good Thai at Aroi Makmak, good pizza at Dolci Amore. Cheap drinks along the beach in San Juan. Cheap breakfast at Mr Crepe.

## Working
[How's the wifi? Where do you work from?]
