5-day bike trip from Onomichi to Imabari, hopping across 10 islands via suspension bridges. Did this solo in October - perfect weather, empty roads, lots of time to think. Way better than rushing it in one day.

## Getting There
Fly into Hiroshima, take local train to Onomichi (1 hour). Hit the art gallery with the view first - sets the tone for what you're about to see from 60 meters up on bridges.

## My Route (5 Days)
**Day 1: Onomichi → Mukaishima → Innoshima** - Easy warm-up islands. Citrus farms everywhere on Innoshima. Try the hassaku oranges - huge and perfectly bittersweet.

**Day 2: Yuge → Ikina → Iwagi Islands** - The forgotten gems. Observation decks with nobody around, local food spots that don't see tourists. Iwagi has amazing views back toward the mainland.

**Day 3: Ikuchijima** - Art island. Sculptures scattered around, good museums, but honestly the coastline views are better than the indoor exhibits.

**Day 4: Omishima** - Ancient Oyamazumi Shrine, Spent hours at the fishing park beside WAKKA trying to catch the legendary seaperch.

**Day 5: Hakatajima → Oshima → Imabari** - Final push to Shikoku. Oshima lighthouse has panoramic views of everything you just crossed. Ended in Imabari and biked around town - surprisingly good local food scene.

## What Makes It Special
The bridges are incredible - cycling 60 meters above blue water with islands stretching to the horizon. Early morning fog lifting off the sea while you're suspended in mid-air.

But taking 5 days lets you find the quiet spots. Observation decks with no crowds, tiny fishing villages, local food that's not in guidebooks. Each island has completely different energy despite being connected.

## Practical Stuff
**Accommodation**: 1 night in Onomichi (start), 1 night in Imabari (end), 3 nights spread across islands. Ryokans and minshuku everywhere.

**Food**: Every island has local specialties. Best meals were always at tiny places recommended by whoever rented me the bike.

**When**: October/November for clear weather and fall colors. Summer is brutal.

**Cost**: Bike rental ¥2000/day, accommodation ¥4000-8000/night, food ¥2500/day

## Tips
Don't rush this. The whole point is slowing down. Pack layers - cold on bridges, warm once you start cycling. Hit observation decks early morning or late afternoon for best light.
