# Introduction
Recently, I had the great privilege of travelling to Hong Kong for the annual flagship conference of IEEE Region 10 (TENCON). One of the papers I co-authored, Enhancing Real-Time License Plate Recognition with Edge Cloud Computing, was accepted as part of the conference's proceedings. While the conference paper contains the relevant results and details regarding the performance and design of our proposed systems, there are a few tangential and interesting details that were not included due to the brevity required in adhering to the 6-page conference format. I hope that this blog post not only sheds light on some of these interesting details, but also illustrates the exact potential of research in this area. 
# Brief Summary
Just to give a brief summary of the research (link), here are the main contributions.
- An application-agnostic edge-cloud computing framework utilizing websockets for communication
- A cloud, edge, and hybrid two-stage license plate recognition system 
- A performance analysis of all three setups with regards to latency, data usage, and performance under specific network conditions
