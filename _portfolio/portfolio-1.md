Recently, I had the great privilege of travelling to Hong Kong for the annual flagship conference of IEEE Region 10 (TENCON). One of the papers I co-authored, Enhancing Real-Time License Plate Recognition with Edge Cloud Computing, was accepted as part of the conference's proceedings. While the conference paper contains the relevant results and details regarding the performance and design of our proposed systems, there are a few tangential and interesting details that were not included due to the brevity required in adhering to the 6-page conference format. 

I hope this blog posts sheds some light on these details, while also providing an interesting account of my experience doing research.
# Brief Summary
Just to give a brief summary of the research [Enhancing Real-Time License Plate Recognition Through Edge-Cloud Computing | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9978152), here are the main contributions.
- An application-agnostic edge-cloud computing framework 
- A cloud, edge, and hybrid two-stage license plate recognition system 
- A performance analysis of all three setups with regards to latency and bandwidth under different network conditions 

# Context
As part of my undergraduate thesis, I was assigned to work on an edge-cloud computing platform for real-time license plate recognition. The idea was to develop and evaluate a system that could recognize license plates in real-time, without relying on a centralized cloud infrastructure. This would allow for greater scalability, as the processing could be distributed across multiple edge devices. 

In addition to building and evaluating said system, I was also tasked with writing an accompanying paper to be submitted to TENCON in the following year.
